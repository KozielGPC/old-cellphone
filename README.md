## Install
This project does not need any dependency to work, but I used the `serve` package to run it on the browser, using a node server, so you can open it on any device at your network.
You can open it as the default way, clickng on `Open as` in the `index.html` archive and choose your browser.
You also need to have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) installed in your machine.

## Execute

You just have to follow the next steps:
```sh
  $ npm init -y # start package.json
  $ npm install serve -D # install serve as a development dependency
  $ npx serve . # running node server
```
